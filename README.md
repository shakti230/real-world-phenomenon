## 1.0 Overview
This repository is intended to review the following in detail:
- Simulate a real world phenomenon which allows me to collect 100 data points across 4 variables. Use the numpy package to create this.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions and their relationships with each other.
- Sumulate a data set matching their properties as closely as possible.
- Detail my research and output the simulation using a Jupyter notebook.
